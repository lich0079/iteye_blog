<li>On Linux, edit your <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or <code>~/.bashrc</code> file. Look for a line that sets the PATH environment variable and add the full path to the <code>tools/</code> directory to it. If you don't see a line setting the path, you can add one: 
 <ul> 
  <code>export PATH=${PATH}:<em>&lt;your_sdk_dir&gt;</em> /tools</code> 
 </ul> </li> 
<li>On a Mac OS X, look in your home directory for <code>.bash_profile</code> and proceed as for Linux. You can create the <code>.bash_profile</code> if you haven't already set one up on your machine. </li> 
<li>On Windows, right-click on My Computer, and select Properties. Under the Advanced tab, hit the Environment Variables button, and in the dialog that comes up, double-click on Path (under System Variables). Add the full path to the <code>tools/</code> directory to the path. </li>

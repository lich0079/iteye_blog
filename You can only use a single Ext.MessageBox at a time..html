<p>You can only use a single Ext.MessageBox at a time. If you try to pop<br> up two boxes at the same time, the first will be replaced by the second. So<br> in some cases, you'll want to check for the presence of an existing dialog<br> in case you inadvertently overwrite the message it is presenting.</p>
